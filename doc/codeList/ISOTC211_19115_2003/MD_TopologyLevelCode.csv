topology1D,"1-dimensional topological complex --  commonly called  chain-node  topology"
planarGraph,"1-dimensional topological complex that is planar. (A planar graph is a graph that can be drawn in a plane in such a way that no two edges intersect except at a vertex.)"
fullPlanarGraph,"2-dimensional topological complex that is planar. (A 2-dimensional topological complex is commonly called  full topology  in a cartographic 2D environment.)"
surfaceGraph,"1-dimensional topological complex that is isomorphic to a subset of a surface. (A geometric complex is isomorphic to a topological complex if their elements are in a one-to-one, dimensional-and boundry-preserving correspondence to one another.)"
fullSurfaceGraph,"2-dimensional topological complex that is isomorphic to a subset of a surface"
