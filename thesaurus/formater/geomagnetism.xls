It is computed from the H-components at approximately four near-equatorial stations at hourly intervals. At a given time, the Dst index is the average of variation over all longitudes; the reference level is set so that Dst is statistically zero on internationally designated quiet days. An index of -50 or deeper indicates a storm-level disturbance, and an index of -200 or deeper is associated with middle-latitude auroras. Dst is determined by the World Data Center C2 for Geomagnetism, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.",,ft:geomagnetism-geomagnetic_indices,,,https://gcmdservices.gsfc.nasa.gov/kms/concept/cdb4b514-75c4-4a1f-a4ad-1855fbd396ab
ft:geomagnetism-geomagnetic_indices-ae_index,"Ae index",,"The AE Index is designed to provide a global, quantitative measure of auroral zone magnetic activity produced by enhanced Ionospheric currents flowing below and within the auroral oval. Ideally, It is the total range of deviation at an instant of time from quiet day values of the horizontal magnetic field (h) around the auroral oval. Defined and developed by Davis and Sugiura [1966], AE has been usefully employed both qualitatively and quantitatively as a correlative index in studies of substorm morphology, the behavior of communication satellites, radio propagation, radio scintillation, and the coupling between the interplanetary magnetic field and the earth's magnetosphere. For these varied uses, AE possesses advantages over other geomagnetic indices or at least shares their advantageous properties.",,ft:geomagnetism-geomagnetic_indices,,,https://gcmdservices.gsfc.nasa.gov/kms/concept/31f77d6b-72f7-45e6-93be-8ac5fd5dc373

Quiet to Unsettled = k 0 to k 3, Active = k 4, Minor Storm = k 5, and Major to Severe Storm = k 6 to k 9.
